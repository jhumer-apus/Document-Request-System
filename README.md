# Document-Request-System

Note: This system was created for the thesis purpose only. 3 college students hired me to create a system based on their topic.

# Description

The Document Request System is an innovative platform that allows users to conveniently request various Barangay documents from Barangay administrators without the need for in-person visits to the Barangay or municipal office. This streamlined process not only saves time but also minimizes physical contact, enhancing accessibility for residents. While certain documents may require specific prerequisites or identification, the system empowers administrators to efficiently review and approve or decline requests, ensuring the smooth and secure delivery of essential documents.
